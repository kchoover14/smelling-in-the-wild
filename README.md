## Odor Identification in Real-World Environments
### Revisiting: Field-testing olfactory ability to understand human olfactory ecology

Olfactory research almost exclusively measures ability in controlled lab settings, yet humans encounter odors in complex, multi-sensory environments. This project revisits a published field study testing odor identification and verbal description across three London locations with distinct ambient odor profiles -- a neutral art museum, a polluted urban street, and a food market -- paired with a controlled lab replication. The reanalysis applies binary accuracy scoring, correspondence analysis, Cain four-level coding, and direction tracking to assess whether alternative analytical approaches change the conclusions. The dominant finding is a design problem, not a null result: repeated exposure within a single session confounds learning with environment, masking any true location effect.
